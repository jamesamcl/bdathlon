We have


Problem 3
=========


Problem 4
=========

We have modified both the SBOL Stack and JBEI ICE.  Our modified version
of JBEI-ICE supports annotated SBOL2 support, which is a major improvement
over the existing SBOL implementation (which serialized SBOL1 and converted
it to SBOL2).  Our modified version of the SBOL Stack features federation of
queries to JBEI-ICE registry instances, meaning queries to the SBOL Stack can
now incorporate data from ICE.
