For this problem, we have successfully connected the SBOL Stack to
JBEI ICE, so that queries to the Stack can retrieve data from ICE
registry instances.

* The `ice/` directory contains a modified version of JBEI-ICE
  with support for annotated SBOL2.0.

* The `sbolstack-api/` directory contains a modified version of
  the SBOL Stack API with support for federation of queries to
  ICE repositories.
